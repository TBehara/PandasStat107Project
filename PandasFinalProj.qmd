## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
Nba_stats <- read.csv("./Teams_Estimated_Metrics_Season23_24.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```
```{r}
plot(Nba_stats$W_PCT, Nba_stats$E_OFF_RATING, main = "Wins from Offensive Ratings", xlab = "Win Percentage", ylab = "Efficiency Offensive Rating", pch = 19)

abline(lm(E_OFF_RATING~W_PCT, data = Nba_stats), col = 'blue')
```
```{r}
plot(Nba_stats$W_PCT, Nba_stats$E_DEF_RATING, main = "Wins from Defensive Ratings", xlab = "Win Percentage", ylab = "Efficiency Defensive Rating", pch = 18)

abline(lm(E_DEF_RATING~W_PCT, data = Nba_stats), col = 'red')
```
The top scatter plot "Wins from Offensive Rating" depicts that there is a positive correlation between efficiency offensive rating and win percentage. A team has a higher win percentage when their offensive ratings are higher.     The scatter plot "Wins from Defensive Ratings" shows that there is a negative correlation between efficiency defensive rating and win percentage. A higher defense rating results in a lower win percentage. This doesn't mean that a team with high defense will lose, but it goes to show that a balance of offensive and defensive rating is needed to win rather than one stats alone
